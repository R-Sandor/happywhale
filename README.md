# Tasks To-do
- ~~Download images directly from Kaggle, there are too many images for github to hold (40gb between train/test) https://www.kaggle.com/c/happy-whale-and-dolphin/data~~
- ~~Break down the species into two categories i.e. whales and dolphins.~~
  - The training csv includes species feature. 
    - Be mindful that some species have whale in the title but are dolphins, e.g. killer whales.
- Research different ways to process images.
  - Consider turning the images into monochrome as the professor has discussed. 
  - Figure out how to do bounding boxes? Will we need to do object recognition? 
  - YOLO for dorsal fin object dection. 
    - Will need to create a label for dorsal fins if this approach is taken.
- Create the IEE report template to fill out the findings.
