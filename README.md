# Tasks To-do
- Download images directly from Kaggle, there are too many images for github to hold (40gb between train/test) https://www.kaggle.com/c/happy-whale-and-dolphin/data
- Break down the species into two categories i.e. whales and dolphins.
- Research different ways to process images.
  - Consider turning the images into monochrome as the professor has discussed. 
  - Figure out how to do bounding boxes? Will we need to do object recognition? 
- Create the IEE report template to fill out the findings.
